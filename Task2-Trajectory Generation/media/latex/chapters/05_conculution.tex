\chapter{Results}\label{results}

To present our results we would like to refer to two videos created as part of the assignment. The first \ref{fig:franka-sim} was done in the Gazebo environment and it performs smoothly and in expected manner. The same could be seen in the video made in the real life setting \ref{fig:franka-real} by applying the same trajectory generators.

\end{figure}


Moreover, we have also conducted several experiments which involved changing impedance controller stiffness. It is interesting to notice how stiffness changes sensitivity of the controller.

    \end{subfigure}

    \label{fig:franka-pos-bag}
\end{figure}

From the position change graph we can conclude that controller behaves little better with bigger stiffness, however, does not provide that much of the difference for the z coordinate which we are most interested in.

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.3\textheight]{figures/f10.png}
        \caption{Force change with linear stiffness = 10 }
        \label{fig:franka-f-10-bag}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{0.46\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.3\textheight]{figures/f13.png}
        \caption{Force change with linear stiffness = 13}
        \label{fig:franka-f-13-bag}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Force changes through time}
    \label{fig:franka-pos-bag}
\end{figure}

We can see the same relation in the force change graph. One last important thing is to notice how position change forms a trapezoid form, exactly as we have programmed it to do.
